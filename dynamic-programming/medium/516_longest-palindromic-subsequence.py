# Testcase Example:  '"bbbab"'
#
# Given a string s, find the longest palindromic subsequence's length in s.
# 
# A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by
# deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining
# elements.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: s = "bbbab"
# Output: 4
# Explanation: One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bbbb".
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: s = "cbbd"
# Output: 2
# Explanation: One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bb".
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 1 <= s.length <= 1000
# s consists only of lowercase English letters.
#

    def longestPalindromeSubseq(self, s: str) -> int:
        n = len(s)

        for i in range(n):
            dp[i][i] = 1
        for length in range(2, n + 1):
            for i in range(n - length + 1):
                j = i + length - 1
                if s[i] == s[j]:
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j - 1] + 2
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])
        return dp[0][n - 1]
