# Testcase Example:  '"abba"\n"dog cat cat dog"'
#
# Given a pattern and a string s, find if sÂ follows the same pattern.
# 
# Here follow means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a
# letter in pattern and a non-empty word in s. Specifically:
# 
# 
# Each letter in pattern maps to exactly one unique word in s.
# Each unique word in s maps to exactly one letter in pattern.
# No two letters map to the same word, and no two words map to the same
# letter.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: pattern = "abba", s = "dog cat cat dog"
# 
# Output: true
# 
# Explanation:
# 
# The bijection can be established as:
# 
# 
# 'a' maps to "dog".
# 'b' maps to "cat".
# 
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: pattern = "abba", s = "dog cat cat fish"
# 
# Output: false
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: pattern = "aaaa", s = "dog cat cat dog"
# 
# Output: false
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 1 <= pattern.length <= 300
# pattern contains only lower-case English letters.
# 1 <= s.length <= 3000
# s contains only lowercase English letters and spaces ' '.
# s does not contain any leading or trailing spaces.
# All the words in s are separated by a single space.
#

                    return False
            else:
                if word in word2char:
                    return False
